<p3> So first of, i went into my github-learning directory and from there i start my journey. </p3>

Steps: 
<ul> 
    <li> I first created a directory using mkdir repotest, then I went into the directory using cd repo so that I can start initizing the directory using git init </li> 
    <li> then, i went onto github and created a repo named the same thing as the directory I have on this ide. </li>
    <li> After I did all that, I went onto github the website to put in the shh so that it pushes to somewhere and not other places out of nowhere. </li>
    <li> Next, I went to the ide and created a file call README.md. Opened it using c9 so I can start editing it in the file directly. </li>
</ul>
After that, I went back to my terminal and used: 
Git add README.md 
git commit -m "" with the thing I want to write inside the qoutes 
furthermore, I did git push -u origin master so that it pushes to github on the website and display it.
As i am typing this, I am doing exactly the same step as lines 10-13
afer i finished with everything, i give it a git push again to display it on github. 
lastly, we are done :)
