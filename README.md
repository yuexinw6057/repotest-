<p3> So first of, i went into my github-learning directory and from there i start my journey. </p3>

Step one: 
I first created a directory using mkdir repotest, then I went into the directory using cd repo so that I can start initizing the directory using git init
then, i went onto github and created a repo named the same thing as the directory I have on this ide.
